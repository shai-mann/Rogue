Monsters have:

	AI:
		Movement AI
		(Optional) Secondary movement AI
		Attack AI

Stats
	Status effects
	Movement speed, etc.

Loot table

Monster (static class) has:

	File loading
	File validation (by level)
	Static monsters list (why?)


Potential improvements:

	1) Break AI into separate classes
	2) Break monster loading into separate class
	3) Have list of monster types that get validated by level and spawned in
	4) Move list of currently spawned monsters into Level or Map?
