Monsters have:

	AI:
		Movement AI
		(Optional) Secondary movement AI
		Attack AI

    Stats
        Status effects
        Movement speed, etc.

    Loot table

Monster (static class) has:

	File loading
	File validation (by level)
	Static monsters list (why?)


Potential improvements:

	1) Break AI into separate classes
	2) Break monster loading into separate class
	3) Have list of monster types that get validated by level and spawned in
	4) Move list of currently spawned monsters into Level or Map?
	5) Convert attribute formatting to be camel case?
	6) Convert player hitting method to send most of monster-related logic into a monster damage() function
	7) Give Monsters an Inventory (items, gold) that each have drop chances that can be included in the Loot Table

Questions for future adjustments:

    1) Does the .getStatus().isSleeping() prevent other movement AIs from running?
        If it doesn't, should it? And if it should, then shouldn't the SleepAI just be as simple
        as initially setting the monster's sleep turns to infinite?
