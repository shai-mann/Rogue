BUGS:
- Scrolls don't always have the same name for the same type
- Both stealGold and stealItem attackTypes need to have the monster run away from player (or tp away) after it steals from player
- stealItem has some bugs with it, but is mostly functional - stealItem should be changed so it only takes certain (magical) items
- Staircase remains in level even when you change levels
- One of the wands causes a monster duplication glitch
- The last loaded row of the table doesnâ€™t show (only in JAR form)
- Button text in BeginPane doesn't appear on Mac
- When monsters drop an item somewhere other than where they are, after picking up, it looks like there is a monster there.
- You can use the scroll of identify on non-hidden objects - the code of the entire hidden and non-hidden items system sucks
- Wand of Polymorph needs to get its file path fixed
- Wand of Suppress Power may make the monster incapable of attacking
- LoadPane doesn't scroll properly (again)
- After loading a saved game, asks if want to save. Should change savepane to not ask if want to overwrite save
- After loading saved game, trying to use staircase causes gamebreaking glitch?
- If you die in a saved game, you can just quit the window and start back up from the last saved spot...
- Switching panes causes frame to become unmaximized no matter what state it was in before
- Scroll of Teleportation moves you a turn after you read it...
- Bottom row of current room doesn't render
- Changing panes resets window's maximized state
- Mimic movement AI doesn't hide monster properly
- If the MessagePane is given an empty string as a message, behaves weirdly


Features To Implement:
- MAKE SURE TO TEST BLINDNESS
- three ring powers
- several wand powers (see animations)
- one scroll type
- change armor to be about damage reduction
- throwing items
- different food potencies
- monster and item spawnChances
- make settings save to a file in data folder, so that settings are saved on exit of game.
- runType movementType would be good, especially for monsters that steal items, becuase then they should run from the player
- traps!!!! Make them spawn, even though they have already technically been implemented.
- on quit, game should reopen BeginPane.
- Make background of BeginPane and LoadPane a bunch of rotating images of the game
- Maybe, and this could be difficult, have the load panel show images of the games that were taken right before they were saved
    Essentially, when saving, take a screenshot of the game (somehow) and then keep it with the save, and display it in the
    loading panel
- Lower damage done by mace
- Bats need to do less damage
- treasure zoos!!!!!!!
- Make something that (in game) is able to show you the function of each of the items.
    It would be based on category, so if you tried to see what a scroll did, it would tell you all powers of all scrolls
    That way it wouldn't give away what the type of scroll is.

ALPHA TESTER SUGGESTIONS:
- kobold attack too high
- make snake less health

Plausible future changes:
    Amulet of Yendor maybe?
    Make the game easier to download and use
    Settings:
        Changeable symbols (walls, floors, player) - cannot be the same as a monster symbol.
        Changeable colors? - monsters, items, player.
        hunger/difficulty - like in Minecraft: easy, normal, hard
