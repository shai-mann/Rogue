1) Why does Entity have a health value? Does food have health??
    1a) General Entity system overhaul? Constructor doesn't take in name - expects to be set later?
    1b) Entity has public fields - bad practice
    1c) Entity directions aren't an enum...
2) Graphic overwriting - perhaps general view layout overhaul
    2a) have view draw map as first layer then overwrite with entities
    2b) make entities and rooms/passageways have a shown/hidden value that determines if the map
        displays them or not.
3) Effects overhaul?
    3a) Currently a class called Effect singular, but has list of effects
    3b) Listeners with MessageBar messages that could act as hooks when effects are applied?
