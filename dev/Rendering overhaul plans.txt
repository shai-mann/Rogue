Planned final rendering process:
    1) Render shown rooms + passageways
    2) Render shown entities
    3) Render animations

Ultimate goal: REMOVE REFERENCES TO "OVERWRITTEN CHARACTERS"

Generation parallel updates:
    1) Fix bounding issues by converting Room boundaries to just use list of points
    2) Give rooms inner and outer collision checks - one to prevent generation issues, another to prevent movement issues
