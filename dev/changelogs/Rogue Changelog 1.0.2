New Features:
    + Settings

    + Resting!
        Note: as requested, hit 'R' to rest, and it will make you heal much faster.

General Bug Fixes:
    + Fixed bug where weapons can be named "null"
    + Possibly fixed issue with game not resizing to fit other screen resolutions (beta testers need to confirm)
    + Fixed duplication glitch with Wand of Teleport To

Item changes:
    + Updated Item spawns (55% chance to have 1 item in a room, 14% chance to have 2 items, 0.02% chance to have 3)
    + Updated Gold amounts that relate to the player's level (minimum gold spawn is 80, maximum is 500)

stealGold and stealItem attack changes:
    + Fixed issue with stealItem attack, now functional - 30% chance on hit for item to be stolen.
    + Fixed bug where stealGold will keep stealing after you have no gold (at one point I had -73 gold)
    + Made stealItem and stealGold monsters drop the stolen items on death

Clarification(s):
    When using f (find), your hunger does NOT go down.
    While resting, monsters WILL move, and your hunger WILL go down.
